# WordCloud
A Gutenberg Editor Block for WordPress to display cloud words from any text. Based on the WP Word Cloud Plugin from nickyreinert.
Developed for the relilab's OER Maker Space (my.relilab.org)

## What is a word cloud?
A word cloud visualizes occurences of words from a text. It counts the words and places them on a canvas. Based on the occurence of each word it calculates the size of the word.
